## Tech stack & Open-source libraries
- Minimum SDK level 21.
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) based, utilizing [Coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) + [Flow](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/) for asynchronous operations.
- Jetpack Libraries:
  - Jetpack Compose: Android‚Äôs modern toolkit for declarative UI development.
  - Lifecycle: Observes Android lifecycles and manages UI states upon lifecycle changes.
  - ViewModel: Manages UI-related data and is lifecycle-aware, ensuring data survival through configuration changes.
  - Navigation: Facilitates screen navigation, complemented by [Hilt Navigation Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/libraries#hilt) for dependency injection.
  - Room: Constructs a database with an SQLite abstraction layer for seamless database access.
  - [Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/): Facilitates dependency injection.
- Architecture:
  - MVVM Architecture (View - ViewModel - Model): Facilitates separation of concerns and promotes maintainability.
- [Retrofit2](https://github.com/square/retrofit): Constructs REST APIs and facilitates paging network data retrieval.
- [Kotlin Serialization](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization): Kotlin multiplatform / multi-format reflectionless serialization.
- [Landscapist Glide](https://github.com/skydoves/landscapist#glide), [animation](https://github.com/skydoves/landscapist#animation), [placeholder](https://github.com/skydoves/landscapist#placeholder): A pluggable, highly optimized Jetpack Compose and Kotlin Multiplatform image loading library that fetches and displays network images with Glide, Coil, and Fresco.
